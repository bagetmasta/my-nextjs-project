# Project Description: NextJS Events

NextJS Events is an application featuring current events. The app has 4 routes:

1. A homepage with featured events.
2. A page with all the events.
3. A page with a detailed description of each event.
4. A page with a list of events relevant to the user's entered month and year.

Any user can leave their email to subscribe to updates with new events. In addition, users have the opportunity to leave comments under each event, and thanks to MongoDB, these comments will be saved and displayed.
